## What is this all about?
I regularly scream during sleep at night. Sometimes once sometimes plenty of times. Most of the times my wife has to wake me up. The number of screams correlates with the stress level within my day-to-day life, so I thought it would be a fun to come up with a project that uses Deep Learning to analyze my screaming behavior.
