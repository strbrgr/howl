## What is this all about?
I regularly scream during sleep at night. Sometimes once sometimes plenty of times. Most of the times my wife has to wake me up. The number of screams correlate to the stress level within my day to day so I thought it would be a fun to come up with a project that uses Deep Learning to analyze my screaming behavior.
